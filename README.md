# Pootis Engage, on Yomi Hustle

This mod is completely based on ceno0's masterpiece Pootis Engage // EXTREME (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGJBUauU-CE).
Features Blue Pootis with all his attacks from the video and more coming soon in the next versions.

As a character Pootis has limited close range attacks, keep in mind everything is from a small take of the masterpiece, so his damage is increased above average, but nothing that could ruin someone's day and most combos (like a couple or more) are based to replicate the ones in the video
